# OvhCloud Json.

While creating ovh cloud module for whmcs, why using mysql for everything? Json i think will be more faster.
also those stuff can be like this and not doing api calls directly to ovh as creation of server will be slower.

You can also limit add/remove what VPS template you want => [Here](https://github.com/systemroot/ovhcloud-json/blob/master/flavors/build.php)
remove or add VPS Images => [Here](https://github.com/systemroot/ovhcloud-json/blob/master/images/build.php)

ssh keys. :/ still working for them..
